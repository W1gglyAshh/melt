| MELT 425 EDITION |
+------------------+

    To Michelle, my BEST FRIEND.

    MELT (short for 'MELT LOVES TERMINAL') is a cross-platform, minimal 
    text editor written in C++ with the ncurses (compatible with pdcurses)
    library.

    This is a special edition of the editor. It will receive bug fixes,
    critical performance patches, and specific features requested by
    Michelle, but it will NOT receive ANY OTHER updates.

    The behavior of this editor is NOT customizable. If you're looking
    for a configurable version, please refer to the "melt" repository.

INTRODUCTION
- MELT is a VERY, VERY lightweight terminal-based text editor, it uses the curses
  library for cross-platform compatibility, and it is kept in one single source file
  (inspired by kilo) for easier maintenance and compilation.

- The initial purpose of creating this program was just for fun. It was originally
  an alternative to kilo that was completely rewritten using the STL Library, and uses
  vim-style modal editing instead of Ctrl key. Later I decided to make it curses-based,
  as mentioned above, for non-unix systems  support (pdcurses).

- This special edition of the program is a gift for my best friend Michelle.
  Celebrating her 14th birthday. We've been through a lot, and this represents
  the solidness of our friendship.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
- With the Makefile, you can easily build the program by typing "make". But you might need
  to tweak the Makefile a bit (it uses clang++ as default compiler, and ncurses instead of
  pdcurses, also you need to completely rewrite the install target yourself if you are on a
  non-unix system).

- Note that this program require compilers that support C++ 17 and above for std::optional. But feel
  free to fork and modify it if you need backward compatibility!
