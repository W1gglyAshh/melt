    MELT (short for 'M-EDITOR LOVES TERMINAL') is a cross-platform, minimal 
    text editor written in C++ with the ncurses (compatible with pdcurses) library.

INTRODUCTION
- MELT is a VERY, VERY lightweight terminal-based text editor, it uses the curses
  library for cross-platform compatibility, and it is kept in one single source file
  (inspired by kilo) for easier maintenance and compilation.

- The initial purpose of creating this program was just for fun. It was originally
  an alternative to kilo that was completely rewritten using the STL Library, and uses
  vim-style modal editing instead of Ctrl key. Later I decided to make it curses-based,
  as mentioned above, for non-unix systems support (pdcurses).

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
- With the Makefile, you can easily build the program by typing "make". But you might need
  to tweak the Makefile a bit (it uses clang++ as default compiler, and ncurses instead of
  pdcurses, also you need to completely rewrite the install target yourself if you are on a
  non-unix system).

- Note that this program require compilers that support C++ 17 and above for std::optional. But feel
  free to fork and modify it if you need backward compatibility!
